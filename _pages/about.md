# 👋 About me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hi, I’m Yu Li (LiYu), a first-year PhD student at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), in a joint PhD program with [PJLab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), advised by [Lijun Wu](https://apeterswu.github.io/), [Feng Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r6CvuOUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). My research focuses on data analysis for large language models, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning.

I previously studied Information Security at Wuhan University (WHU) and conducted undergraduate research in the [NIS&P Lab](https://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/) under [Qian Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CD7ybnAAAAAJ).
I’m always happy to connect and discuss research ideas or potential collaborations—feel free to reach out.
